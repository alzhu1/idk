  <h2>Erick</h2>
  <p id="legibleTag">What's up, guys? My name's Erick, and I'm from Whittier, CA. I was born in Bellflower, CA. I came back to Whittier and graduated from California High School -- real original name, I know haha. I was in band since the seventh grade, and I play the alto saxophone. I'm the oldest of three and virtually the only guy in my family -- not just household, I mean whole family. I thought gender was supposed to be a 50/50 chance lol. Anyways, I will be attending UC San Diego in the fall with intentions of joining the computer science program. I'm definitely excited to start life hahaha. I love listening to music. Music taste? Uuuh, let's just say it's eclectic? I listen to a lot of different genres. The most prominent are probably indie, alternative, and rap. Singing, tapping, rapping, or drumming, if there's music playing, you'll probably catch me doing one of 'em. I love hanging out with family and friends; socializing; laughing at jokes with people, driving with no destination, and learning random, new things because you never know when it'll come in handy. I'm a real laidback person.</p>

    <h2>Hariklia</h2>
    <p id="legibleTag">
  Hi! I'm Hariklia, and I go by a multitude of nicknames with Aria, Ari, Klia, and Harik being the most common because Hariklia is kinda tough to pronounce (: I'm from San Carlos, CA, about 30 minutes south of SF. I have three older brothers and one younger one, so I grew up half-princess, half-tomboy. I will be attending UC Berkeley in the fall. I love playing my trumpet, playing soccer, singing, reading (mostly fantasy and sci-fi) and writing for and designing on my school's news website (except graduated now, ahh). fun fact: my hair is about 3 feet long. I have a ton of funny soccer pictures where people trying to get the ball from me are blinded by my ponytail =Pï»¿</p>
